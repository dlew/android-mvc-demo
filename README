This is a small demo project that I setup in order to demonstrate how you can
setup Fragment-based Android apps with a simple model-view-controller design.

There are three classes here:

InstanceFragment - the model, it is retained between config changes

MyFragment - the view, it displays the UI

MainActivity - the controller, it sets up the model/view and regulates the 
               flow between the two.
